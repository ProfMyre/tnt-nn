In this directory you should find tntnn.m, the source file for the TNT-NN method.  
This file contains all associated functions and an implementation of the TNT 
unconstrained least-squares method.

Run this matlab script as:
x = tntnn(A, b);

where A is the m x n matrix representing the system of equations, b is the 
solution column vector (length m) of measured data, and x is the column 
vector (length n) of parameters obtained to best fit the solution vector and 
minimize the 2-norm of the solution residual.

Additional parameters that can be supplied to tntnn() include:
min_coeff_val: smallest allowed coefficient value (i.e. instead of constraining to non-zero solutions, we constrain ci > min_coeff_val)
max_coeff: maximum number of allowed non-zero coefficients.
lambda:   The Tikhonov regularization parameter
rel_tol:  A relative tolerance for comparing solution improvement
AA:       The precalculated normal equations
use_AA:   A flag indicating to use AA (when set to 1)
red_c:    Reduction constant for the active set
exp_c:    Expansion constant for the active set
